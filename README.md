# React Wordle

This is a simple Wordle clone for learning purposes.

Welcome to React Wordle, a clone of the popular word game Wordle, built using React and TypeScript. With this app, users can play the game and view statistics of their played games, such as number of wins, loses and win/loss ratio.

React Wordle implements state management using React and makes use of the browser's local storage to store and display the user's game statistics. The app also utilizes the TailwindCSS library for styling.

## Demo

A demo of the game can be found [here](https://reactwordle.netlify.app/).
